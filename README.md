# User Story

AS A coding
boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that
stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock WHEN all questions are answered or the
timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my
initials and score
